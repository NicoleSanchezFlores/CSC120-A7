- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?


In this case, I chose to overload the CampusMap class's addBuilding. Overloading methods allows me to create numerous methods with the same name but distinct parameter lists. I decided to overload the addBuilding method with two versions.  one  accepts a single Building parameter and adds it to the campus map, and another that takes three parameters representing the building's name, address, and number of floors and creates a new Building object with these attributes. It helps flexibility by allowing the user to add a building to the map directly by providing its details rather than generating a Building object before, which helps the CampusMap class' usefulness.




- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I still like this project, i think maybe providing an example of overloading would be useful.
